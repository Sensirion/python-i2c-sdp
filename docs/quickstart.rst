SensorBridge Example
--------------------

Following example code shows how to use this driver with a Sensirion SDP8xx
connected to the computer using a `Sensirion SEK-SensorBridge`_. It is assumed,
that the sensor is plugged into port 1 of the SensorBridge and COM Port 1 is
used on the computer. The driver for the SensorBridge can be installed with

.. sourcecode:: bash

    pip install sensirion-shdlc-sensorbridge

Depending on the sensor type you connect set the I2C address accordingly when
creating the SdpI2cDevice instance. For more details see comments in the code.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import time
    from sensirion_shdlc_driver import ShdlcSerialPort, ShdlcConnection
    from sensirion_shdlc_sensorbridge import SensorBridgePort, \
        SensorBridgeShdlcDevice, SensorBridgeI2cProxy
    from sensirion_i2c_driver import I2cConnection
    from sensirion_i2c_sdp import SdpI2cDevice

    # Connect to the SensorBridge with default settings:
    #  - baudrate:      460800
    #  - slave address: 0
    with ShdlcSerialPort(port='COM1', baudrate=460800) as port:
        bridge = SensorBridgeShdlcDevice(ShdlcConnection(port), slave_address=0)
        print("SensorBridge SN: {}".format(bridge.get_serial_number()))

        # Configure SensorBridge port 1 for SDP
        bridge.set_i2c_frequency(SensorBridgePort.ONE, frequency=100e3)
        bridge.set_supply_voltage(SensorBridgePort.ONE, voltage=3.3)
        bridge.switch_supply_on(SensorBridgePort.ONE)

        # Create SDP device
        #
        # Make sure to use the correct i2c address:
        # SDP8xx can support 0x25 and 0x26, SDP3x can support 0x21, 0x22 and 0x23.
        # Refer to the dedicated datahseet for more detailed information.
        i2c_transceiver = SensorBridgeI2cProxy(bridge, port=SensorBridgePort.ONE)
        sdp = SdpI2cDevice(I2cConnection(i2c_transceiver), slave_address=0x25)
        sdp.stop_continuous_measurement()
        sdp.start_continuous_measurement_with_mass_flow_t_comp()

        # Measure
        while True:
            differential_pressure, temperature = sdp.read_measurement()
            # use default formatting for printing output:
            print("{}, {}".format(differential_pressure, temperature))
            # custom printing of attributes:
            print("{:0.2f} Â°C ({} ticks), {:0.2f} Pa ({} ticks)".format(
                temperature.degrees_celsius, temperature.ticks,
                differential_pressure.pascal, differential_pressure.ticks))
            time.sleep(0.2)
